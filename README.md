Hacking a plywood case
====

Messing around with a shape I want to put together in plywood with some
oddly placed 60-degree angles. Sort of a skewed truncated pyramid.

Things still to do
----

I need to be able to pull out a 2D shape for each vertex, and then tile
all those shapes onto a sheet of plywood for laser engraving.

I want to be able to pull out STL files for interior corner blocks that
can be 3D printed, and they should ideally have holes in them to take
wood screws. And I need to figure out where those holes come out on the
exterior surfaces. On the longer edges, there should be multiple blocks,
not just in the corners.
